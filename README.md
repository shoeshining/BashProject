Purpose: Notify me on my phone if my server exceeds a certain ram threshold, using Deacon's REST Api.

Why it's useful: Deacon already handles ram monitoring internally in a more robust fashion. This is more of a proof of concept that demonstrates how you can use third party scripts/software to make custom notifications. Perhaps you have a different server that is not running a Deacon node that you would like to receive notifications for.
